## Project Details

### Tech Stack

Our project is built using the following technologies:

- **ReactJs**: A popular framework for building web applications using JavaScript and React.
- **Node and Express**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Express.js is a web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.
- **solidity**: Solidity is a high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

### File Structure

Our project's file structure is organized as follows:

- **Verify Bharat**
  - `cache`: Stores temporary data to improve performance.
  - `client`: Contains the React.js code for the user interface.
  - `contracts`: Contains the Solidity code for the smart contracts.
  - `scripts`: Contains scripts for automating tasks, such as deploying the smart contracts or running the tests.
  - `server`: Contains the Node.js and Express.js code for the server.
  - `test`: Contains tests for the Solidity code and the React.js code.
